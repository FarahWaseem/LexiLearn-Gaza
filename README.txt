This project is an interactive web page that allows the user to choose from three categories:

Food

Travel

Art

After the user makes a selection, a request is sent to the Google Gemini API to retrieve a title and description related to Gaza within the chosen category.

How it works:

The user selects a category from the dropdown menu.

When the "Submit" button is clicked, a custom prompt is created for the API to request data in JSON format.

The title and description from the response are extracted and displayed on the page.

Technologies used:

HTML + CSS + Vanilla JavaScript

Google Gemini API

Purpose of the project:
To present concise and organized information about Gaza based on the userâ€™s area of interest.
